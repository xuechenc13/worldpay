Restful API #127.0.0.1/offer

There are several assumption below :

1. Users know the offer id so that they can query and delete the offer by id.

2. Frontend developers will deal with expire date on the screen, thus when query an offer, no matter whether this offer has been expired yet, an offer will be provided. 

3. An interface should be implemented when other developers would like to storage date in different way.
